<p>These baked pork chops with cream of mushroom soup are fork-tender — when done right. They're great comfort food for cold days! The cream of mushroom soup gravy is great on both the pork chops and mashed potatoes.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>½ yellow onion, sliced</li>
        <li>4 pork chops</li>
        <li>26 ounces condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>2 cubes beef bouillon</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place onion slices on the bottom of a glass baking dish. Lay pork chops over onions. Cover chops evenly with condensed soup.</li>
        <li>Add water and bouillon, breaking up the bouillon cubes to spread flavor. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake pork chops in the preheated oven, stirring gravy once or twice, until no longer pink in the centers, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
